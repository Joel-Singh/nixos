# TODO

Make a dedicated game document and ask David to review

Run the snakes on separate processes with a time limit

A way to run the game programmatically and keep a running count of the results as it happens. Round Robin Style.

Maybe since the snakes will be separate processes communicating through std-in and std-out, we can create more than just a cpp programming interface and just point it to the appropriate binary.

## Done, just needs to merge. will do after Colin's feedback

Instructions for setting command line flags for vs code

Fix heads going into each other being them swapping positions or a win.

After 100 ticks, the longer snake wins.
